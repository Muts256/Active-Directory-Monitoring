<h2>👨‍💻 System Information and Event Management (SIEM)</h2>

### Active Directory Monitoring

Active Directory (AD) monitoring using Sysmon and Splunk to enhance security visibility. Configured Sysmon on the domain controller, and a Windows 10 client joined to the domain to capture critical security events. This setup improves threat detection and incident response capabilities by providing deeper insights into system and user activity.

### Objective:
  - Installation and configuration of Splunk, Active Directory, and Sysmon.
  - Search and analyze events on Splunk.
  - Detect, analyze, and investigate a Brute Force Attack.

### Tools & Technologies
  - Active Directory (AD) on Windows Server 2025, Windows 10 device
  - Splunk forwarder and Sysmon installed on the AD and Windows 10 device
  - Splunk server installed on an Ubuntu server
  - Kali Linux 
  - AtomicRedTeam mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework for penetration testing.
    
### Lessons Learned:
  - Installation and configuration of Splunk, Active Directory, and Sysmon.
  - Using MITRE ATT&CK and Atomic Red Team frameworks to generate tests
  - Using Splunk to search for anomalies.
  - Installation of Active Directory and Domain Services.
